<h2>Custom Cars Company</h2>

<h4>Client: School of the Museum of Fine Arts</h4>

<p>Inspired by the original design of Mr Norm's Garage Custom Cars Company 
was the very first website That I completed while studying Beginner Web
 Design at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.</p>

<p>CCM features creme de la creme of custom steel beasts
from Cuda-71 to Challenger 800a
plus shop where you can purchase car parts.</p>

the ground-up in Dreamweaver and runs on CSS2 and HTML4.</p>

<h2>Atomizer</h2>

<h4>Created in: 2011</h4>

<h4>Client: School of the Museum of Fine Arts</h4>

<p>Atomizer is an independent record label which shares
the name with an album by the almighty Big Black. Design inspiration was provided 
by websites for non-fictional labels like Dangerbird and Nonesuch.</p>

<p>With a roster that includes such luminaries as Brainiac,
Tribes of Neurot, Flaming Lips and countless others, you're 
guaranteed to find something to enjoy during your next listening
session.


</p>

<p>Much like its predecessor, Atomizer runs on HTML and CSS, 
but also utilizes jQuery plugin called s3Slider.
